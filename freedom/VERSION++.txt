Bryan Ford suggested something that made me think of this.

An initial bad request to a mod freedom server returns a 404 page with a freshly 
generated proof of work embedded in the headers, perhaps a set-cookie.

Solving the proof of work on the client side yields a password and a session id.
Both of these must be submitted along with the IBC crypto that establishes the shared
secret. The mod_freedom server only checks the IBC crypto if the session id and
password are **valid**. 


This makes it a two step dance, but still reasonably simple.
