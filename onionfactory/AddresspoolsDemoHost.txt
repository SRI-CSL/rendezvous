Hi,

Under *.demo.safdef.isc.org there are a couple of hosts:

lnxddbp
lnxddbs
lnxdgw

That together make up a demo environment, as they are running their
respective components.

At:
 http://lnxdgw.demo.safdef.isc.org/safdef/netblock/list/

you can find a simple webinterface where one can see which netblocks are
currently live on that host.

Under http://lnxdgw.demo.safdef.isc.org/safdef/net-fetcher/ one can then request
"Discovery Provisioning Details" (or NEP as it is called in the paper).

Cut those lines in a file and then on a host where you compiled the
addresspools code on, you should be able to use the ACS dancer
(acs-dancer) to do a "acs-dancer filename.net" to do the ACS dance of the
DEFIANCE framework, which will result in the details for the bridge.

Greets,
 Jeroen
