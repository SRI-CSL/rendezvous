Mostly notes to self.

====================

Next steps: 

play nice and fair with other modules, this may require some work, and experimentation.
AddHandler rather than SetHandler? DECLINE rather than handle in the default case? 
configuration & persistence
function?


====================

Design desiderata:

Nice customizable behavior.
General and extensible.
Capable of reporting to defiance servers.
Supports multimodes of contact.


======================

Notes to self:

ErrorDocument can be set in the context of a server, virtual host, directory, or  .htaccess 
So I suppose the SetHandler can also be called in such a context, so we should handle
both server and directory configuration directives if we implement any at all, that is.


=======================

Minimal requirements for a early November demo.

need to configure:

a server to get the list of replies

somewhere to store the replies

OR MORE SIMPLY  just a list of replies.

what makes a 404 a defiance request?

anything else to make the backend bit securable?

=========================

crypto sketch from Vinod


client   --------  (symmetric key | payload) encrypted with server's public key  ------> server


server ------- ((secret) signed by defiance public key) encrypted by symmetric key


how does the client get the server's public key?

how does the server load data such as keys? See what mod_ssl does, and where it looks for
certificates etc.

=========================

Version 2.0 check list.

Must test in prefork and worker. So need to handle locks.

Need to build the infrastructure to send a new list.

Need to do crypto on BOTH types of requests.

Need to generate defiance keys
