0. mod_freedom is configured  using the apache configuration file.

1. onionfactory is configured by environment variables and mysql tweakage

get_nep  will need to look up the NET server from: DEFIANT_ONIONFACTORY_NET_URL

         if the environment variable is NULL we should fake a NET but be VERBOSE about it

pack_nep will need to look up the class path from: DEFIANT_CLASSPATH

         if the environment variable is NULL we should FAIL VERBOSELY
