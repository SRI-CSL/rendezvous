======================================================================

One set of keys currently:

Set one:  The Defiance Pair

   defiant_private.pem
   defiant_public.pem

These are the DEFIANCE keys. They are ONLY used for signing
and verifying ONIONS. Thus the client is configured
to contain ONLY the public.pem which it uses to verify onions served
by mod_freedom. In addition mod_freedom is configured to contain ONLY
the public.pem which it uses to verify onions that are delivered to it 
by the Defiance Discovery Provisioning Server. Only
the  Defiance Discovery Provisioning Server is configured to 
contain the private key.
