Ian's Rendezvous playground.

Stuff here is used in three different scenarios: 

      1. The QT client (C++)
      2. The apache module (C + apr)
      3. The onionfactory (C + thttpd + mysql)

defiantclient.[ch] is the main library; 

kept simple to be included in qt apache and administration.
no onions in it.

onion.[ch] is the onion specific stuff

defiantbf.[ch] is the implementation of BasicIdent of Boneh Franklin

defiant[masterkey, params, pkg]_[info, generator].c  are part of the IBE toolchain
as is 

defiantparams_check.c
